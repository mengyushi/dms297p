# Dormitory Management System

Because of the Covid-19 Pandemic, we are spending much more time at home, staying together with our families, or our roommates. What can we do to help to solve the trivial things in our home? Here comes our Dormitory Management System, a web application that can help us handling things like splitting bills, order groceries/deliveries, and schedule house cleaning together.
